A php website with login/logout ability along with storing all our organization's (Esports at Cornell) photos using tags, similar to Instagram.

This website supports login/logout capability but does not allow you to create accounts. Then, it features searching through a sql database based on a chosen tag and displays all photos with that tag. All information is initiated on a sql file that is compatible with any service.

Main purposes of the site include storing photos for all admin officers of the organization along with being able to search through tags easily to find pictures that match a tag.
